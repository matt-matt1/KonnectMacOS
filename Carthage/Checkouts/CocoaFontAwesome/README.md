# CocoaFontAwesome

## About

CocoaFontAwesome is a port of [FontAwesome.swift](https://github.com/thii/FontAwesome.swift) of [thii](https://github.com/thii) to macOS with some additions. Since we wanted to center the resulting icon in the `NSImage`, we trim the transparent pixels if the background color is set to `NSColor.clear`.

## Usage

Integrate it either manually or using Carthage.
